## Installation

On jupyter.nesi.org.nz, open a terminal and clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/neon-ninja/crash_prediction.git
```
then change directory:
```
cd crash_prediction
```
and use the Makefile to install dependencies and create a conda environment:
```
make venv_nesi
```

If you are using this code on a regular computer (not HPC), make sure you have:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads),
- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed,
- [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install.html) or another program to run
  notebooks,
- the `make` command.

Then clone this repository, for example from a terminal using:
```
git clone https://github.com/neon-ninja/crash_prediction.git
```
change directory and install all dependencies using `make`:
```
cd crash_prediction
make venv
```

Whichever way you installed the code, now you can run the provided notebooks
using the `crash_prediction` kernel.
